Argument Reference site - (Required) For Confluence Cloud: The site is the name of the site and appears in your wiki URL (https:// my-site.atlassian.net /wiki/spaces/my-space/). For Confluence Server users this should be the hostname of your Confluence instance that can receive /rest/api requests. This can also be set via the CONFLUENCE_SITE environment variable. site_schema - (Optional) Set the schema for connecting to the REST API. Defaults to https . This can also be set via the CONFLUENCE_SITE_SCHEMA environment variable. public_site - (Optional) For Confluence Server instances where your Confluence site URL is different than the hostname that serves REST API requests. Defaults to site if not set. This can also be set via the CONFLUENCE_PUBLIC_SITE environment variable. public_site_schema - (Optional) Set the schema for generated public URLs. Defaults to https .

For Confluence Server this is the username of the user to login. This can also be set via the CONFLUENCE_USER environment variable. token - (Required) For Confluence Cloud the token is a secret every user can generate. It is similar to a password and should be treated as such. For Confluence Server, this is the password of the user. This can also be set via the CONFLUENCE_TOKEN environment variable.
